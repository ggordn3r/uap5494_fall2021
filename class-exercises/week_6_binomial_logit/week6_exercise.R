# This week, we will try to predict whether a wine is white or red based on other chemical and perceptual characteristics.
# Download the datasets here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
library(tidyverse)

# Hint: you should create a new variable before merging the two datasets.

# Create a logit model using the rest of the variables to predict whether a wine is white or red.

# Create a confusion matrix of your predictions vs. actual values.

# Plot the log-likelihood as illustrated in the Statsquest video part 3.
