# Plot the data. Does it make sense to log transform your variable? Why or why not?

# Test for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and non-stationarity.
# Interpret the results in a comment.

# calculate and plot first differences.
# Compare this to the raw data in a comment. When does it make sense to use differences instead of raw data?

# decompose the data and plot the figures

# create an ARIMA model from the data

# forecast the next 2 years of your variable

# plot the forecast
# Interpret the results in a comment. Why is the range so large?

# Validate your forecast with a Box test.
# Interpret the test output in a comment.
